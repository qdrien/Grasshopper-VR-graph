# eNTERFACE-graph-architecture

Version of Unity used: 2018.1.9f2

Goals:    
- Bring GH graphs into VR (e.g. table metaphor)
- Capitalize on the 3rd dimension for an alternative visualization (e.g. z axis linked to how deep we are in the graph)
- Enable graph editing and try different interaction options for the following actions:
  - Add a component (a node in the graph)
  - Remove a component
  - Move a component
  - Add a link (an edge in the graph)
  - Remove a link
  - Move the viewpoint (what part of the graph we currently see)
  - Scale the viewpoint (zoom in/out in the graph)
  - Add/remove/"resize" group?
